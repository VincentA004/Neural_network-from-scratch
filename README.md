# Neural_network-from-scratch

## Overview
This project is something I did to learn what really goes on inside the "black box" of a neural network. Such as how does back progation and gradient decent
really work together to optimize a set of random weights and biases so that it can predict a correct digit. This project is all coded from scratch with the help of numpy\
This program classifies pictures of digits and displays the correct digit based on an image input

## Repository information
- NN.py:  is the code file which contains actual neural network and image preprocessor
- handwriting_detector.py:  is the runner file which contains a command line GUI to interact with the model and change hyper_parameters

## Data
This program uses the MNIST data set\

## Technologies used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
